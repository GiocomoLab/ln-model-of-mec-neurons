%% Description
% This code will section the data into 10 different portions. Each portion
% is drawn from across the entire recording session. It will then
% fit the model to 9 sections, and test the model performance on the
% remaining section. This procedure will be repeated 10 times, with all
% possible unique testing sections. The fraction of variance explained, the
% mean-squared error, the log-likelihood increase, and the mean square
% error will be computed for each test data set. In addition, the learned
% parameters will be recorded for each section.
